# Explainable AI-Based Alzheimer’s Disease Detection

This project focuses on detecting Alzheimer’s disease stages from brain MRI images
using Transfer Learning and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).

## Features
- Brain MRI-based Alzheimer stage classification
- Multi-class prediction (Non, Very Mild, Mild, Moderate)
- Transfer Learning (EfficientNet / ResNet)
- Explainable AI using Grad-CAM and LIME
- Flask-based web application
- Cloud deployment using Google Colab

## Modules
1. User Interface
2. Image Preprocessing
3. Transfer Learning Model
4. Explainable AI (XAI)
5. Result Visualization

## Project Status
Core modules implemented.
Model optimization and documentation are in progress.
